In Assignment 1 and the following Assignment 2, use WebGL and JavaScript (but not three.js), 
and the mathematics package that comes with the textbook, to develop a two-dimensional 
interactive game “Super Bug Zapper” with the following features: 
 
1. The playing field starts as a circular disk centered at the origin. 
2. The player views the disk from above.  
3. Bacteria grow on the circumference of the disk starting at an arbitrary spot on the 
circumference and growing out uniformly in all directions from that spot at a speed 
determined by the game. 
4. The bacteria appear as a crust on the circumference of the disk. 
5. The game can randomly generate up to a fixed number (say 10) of different bacteria 
(each with a different color).
